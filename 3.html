<h1><font size="10">Artificial intelligence has become an umbrella term for applications that perform complex tasks that once required human input, such as communicating with customers online or playing a game of chess. The term is often used interchangeably with its sub-fields, which include machine learning and deep learning. However, there are differences.. For example, machine learning focuses on creating systems that learn or improve their performance based on the data you consume. It is important to note that although all machine learning is AI, not all AI is machine learning.

    To get the full value from AI, many companies are making significant investments in data science teams. Data science, an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific and other methods to extract value from data, combines skills from fields such as statistics and computer science with scientific knowledge to analyze data collected from multiple sources.</font> </h1>
