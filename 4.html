<h1><font size="10">There are many success stories that prove the value of artificial intelligence. Companies that add machine learning and cognitive interaction to traditional business processes and applications can dramatically improve user experience and enhance productivity.

    However, there are some obstacles. Few companies have deployed AI on a large scale, for several reasons. For example, if they do not use cloud computing, AI projects are often very expensive. They are also complex to construct and require expertise in high demand with insufficient supplies. Knowing when and where to integrate AI, as well as when to turn to third parties, will help reduce these difficulties.</font> </h1>
